# 🥗 My Simple Jekyll Website

This is a personal website I built using **Jekyll** and **GitHub Pages** to document my weekly diet, nutritional breakdowns, and where to buy the food I eat.

## 🌐 Website Structure

The site consists of three main pages linked together:

1. **index.md** — The homepage. Shows a summary of my daily diet with a link to more details.
2. **details.md** — Full weekly diet log with meals and hydration.
3. **shopping-guide.md** — A guide showing where I shop for ingredients, including links to online stores.

Each page is written in Markdown and rendered with the help of Jekyll's layout system.
